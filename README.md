# Exploring Sales Data in SQL and Tableau 
# Introduction
we explore a sales dataset and generate various analytics and insights from customers' past purchase behavior. We go from analyzing sales revenue to creating a customer segmentation analysis using the RFM technique. We go from basic SQL queries to exploring complex problems using SUB QUERY, CTEs, AGGREGATE, and WINDOW functions.

# Skills used
- Importing a file into SQL Server Database
- SQL Aggregate Functions
- SQL Window Functions
- SQL Sub Query
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- SQL XML Path Function
- Tableau for data visualization

# SQL Analysis
In this analysis from our sales data, we uncover the business questions that arise.

We first:
- Check there unique values then
- Started by grouping sales by productline
- Finding out the year that they made the most sales
- Concluded the type of package that generates the most revenue.
- We got the best month for sales in a specific year, and what was generated?
- Finding out what they sell in that month?
- Who is the best customer through RFM analysis?
- What products are most often sold together?

# Tableau for Data visualization
We used Tableau to display our sales data. To display our data effectively, we created two sales dashboards:
